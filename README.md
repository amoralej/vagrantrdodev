# vagrantrdodev

This repo contains vagrantfile and ansible playbooks I use to create my dev environments for RDO and DLRN

This vagrantfile can deploy VMs both in libvirt and openstack using plugins:

vagrant-libvirt
vagrant-openstack-provider

For OpenStack, authentication parameters must be declared as environment variables (keystonerc style).
